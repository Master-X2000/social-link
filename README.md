## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I was able to elaborate my knowledge on variable fonts with this challenge.

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Inter';
    src: url(assets/fonts/Inter-VariableFont_slnt\,wght.ttf)
    format(ttf);
    font-display:swap;
    font-weight:100 900
}
```
### Continued development

I will definately be working on more variable fonts and how to use it better.
